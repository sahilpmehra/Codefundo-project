What am I planning to build?

I plan to build an app that predicts the probability of floods in a certain area and notifies all users in that area immediately.
Along with this feature, on the user end, I intend to provide another feature. This feature will notify the rescue mission teams and other authorities about the condition of damage and emergency in a particular area. This feature will use GFMS(GLobal Flood Management System) and also input from the users in that area to keep a double check on the situation in that area. 
I intend to use machine learning algorithms to predict the probability of floods in a certain region based on past data and current situation.


How does it work?

The app has the following features:

1) Using GFMS, the app will look into areas of heavy rainfall. Then, based on the past rainfall pattern in that area and the upstream rain events near that area, it will predict the probability and extent of floods in that area. The situation will be allocated to different categories dependent on the details measured and predictions. The authorities will be constantly notified of the different situations in different areas. Even the users can view the situation of flood in their area on the map.

2) During the floods, for better management and prevention of excessive damage to life and property, users can use the app to ask for help and that will send their current location to the authorities. The authorities will be able to view all these locations on the map with even the shortest possible path for saving maximum lives.

3) The users who are stuck in the floods or have lost their houses in the floods will be guided to their nearest relief camps through the map.

What technologies will I be using?

MapMyIndia APIs for maps, navigation, etc. ; Global Flood Management System(GFMS) API for constantly checking the condition in the region;
Android; Azure Cloud Computing
